# Welcome to Nest Mission!


**Nest Mission** is a project that aims to train me with the following technologies:

 - NestJs
 - Typescript
 - MongoDB
 - React.js
 - As well as programming concepts, like some patterns that use **event architecture**.
 
# Goal
The goal is that a **company** can be listed and propose a list of **activities**.
**Users** can view the activities (via geolocation), and **book** them.
Each activity has a limit of users, has a price, etc...
I plan to document via OpenAPI.
